I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Institute for Experiential AI at the Northeastern University. I received my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering (Transportation) from [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) and obtained my Bachelor degree from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/). 

I'm interested in the transportation systems in general, as well as the broad civil infrastructure systems supported by transportation. I use a wide range of artificial intelligence methods (including deep (graph) learning and reinforcement learning) to analyze and manage the operational efficiency, resilience, and security of these systems.
