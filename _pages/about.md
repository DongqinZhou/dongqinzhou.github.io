I am a Postdoc Research Fellow in the Institute for Experiential AI at the Northeastern University. I received my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering (Transportation) from [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) and obtained my Bachelor degree from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/). 

I'm interested in managing and optimizing the transportation system in general. Particularly, I wish to address widespread traffic problems, such as congestion and resilience, with advanced technologies like macroscopic modeling, reinforcement learning, and network science.

Research Interests
======
* Deep reinforcement learning
* Traffic operations and control
* Intelligent transportation systems
* Infrastructure resilience
* Climate modeling and simulation
